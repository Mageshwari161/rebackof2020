<p><h2>When will this pandemic end?” is a question we’ve heard with 
increasing frequency this year. In the final weeks of 2020,  
it seems the world is closer to getting an answer, as vaccines begin to<img src="covid.jpg" height=200 width=335><br>   
slowly roll out across the world, offering hope for an end to a pandemic 
that’s devastated lives and livelihoods around the world. 
The COVID-19 outbreak is one of many events<img src="amazon.jpg" height=200 width=335><br> 
that have made 2020 a year like no other. From the ensuing public health<br>  
crisis—and its toll on diverse communities, mental health, and<br>  
small businesses, to name just a few—to the increasing urgency of climate change,<br> 
to a watershed movement in racial and social justice, the year<br>  
has brought more change than many could have imagined<br>
It can be hard to feel optimistic when there are still so many challenges ahead.<br>  
But in a year of unprecedented change, we also feel hopeful,       <img src="aus.jpg" height=200 width=335> 
having seen time and time again the power of people to help each other <br> 
through this crisis, sometimes against all odds. As 2020 comes to a close,<br>  
we share this look at some of the year’s milestones and what we’re looking forward to in 2021. </h2></p>
